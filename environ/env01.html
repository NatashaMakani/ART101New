            For years, each night I've fallen asleep, there has been a chance I find myself dreaming in an unfamiliar landscape.
            It was a strange, uncanny yet persistent environment that stayed mostly consistent each time I'd visit. Across several nights of effort, I mapped out most of it for my own amusement. 
            <br><br>
            I'd like invite you to join me now, to explore it together.

            Plenty of strange beings inhabit these lands. They're quite bizarre, forgive the depths of my unconscious for that. This one is named Hank. I don't know what he is, but he looks quite goofy.
